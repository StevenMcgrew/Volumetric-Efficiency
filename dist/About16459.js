In simple terms, it is a measure of how well an engine is able to take in air. For example, if one of the cylinders in an engine has a swept volume of 0.5L, and that cylinder took in 0.5L of air during the intake stroke, then it has 100% VE. </p><p data-v-18262cc1> Older engine designs will have around 80-90% VE. More advanced engine designs will have 90-100% VE (and sometimes slightly more). Supercharged and turbocharged engines will have over 100%. The best way to know if your engine&#39;s VE is okay, is to compare it to a known good value from the same engine design. This app has a database of VE values from several different engines that comes from users like you who choose to save their calculations for everyone to use for comparisons. </p><h3 data-v-18262cc1>How to use the VE calculator</h3><ol data-v-18262cc1><li data-v-18262cc1> Connect your scan tool to the car and set it to record these data PIDs: RPM, MAF and IAT. If you record more PIDs, then the data transfer could be too slow. You will need to save your recording so that you can review it in later steps. </li><br data-v-18262cc1><li data-v-18262cc1> Find a safe area to drive the car at wide open throttle (WOT) until the RPMs are close to redline. It&#39;s important to keep the throttle wide open, because you are testing how well the engine can take in air. </li><br data-v-18262cc1><li data-v-18262cc1> Review your recording and find the point where RPM&#39;s and MAF are at or near their highest values. Use this point to collect your values for MAF, RPM, and IAT. </li><br data-v-18262cc1><li data-v-18262cc1> Input the values into the calculator, along with the engine size in Liters and the elevation of your location. Then click the CALCULATE button to get the result. </li><br data-v-18262cc1><li data-v-18262cc1> BONUS: Save the result of your calculation, so that you and others can use it to make comparisons in the future. </li><br data-v-18262cc1><li data-v-18262cc1> BONUS: Search for similar vehicles and engines to see how your vehicles VE compares. That way you can make a judgement as to whether or not your vehcile has lower than normal VE. </li><br data-v-18262cc1><li data-v-18262cc1> BONUS: When you perform a search, the charts will update with the search results, and your current result will show up in the charts as a white line. Sometimes these charts are useful for making a visual comparison. </li></ol><h3 data-v-18262cc1>How to interpret the results</h3><p data-v-18262cc1> VE varies with engine design, so it&#39;s best to compare to a known good value for your engine. Low VE calculations can be caused by a faulty MAF sensor that is sending inaccurate data to your scan tool, or it can be from an engine breathing problem. To figure out which is the case, take another road test and this time record all of the fuel trim data PIDs. If fuel trims show large positive values at medium to high load, then the MAF sensor is suspected to be faulty or the air flowing through it has been compromised. If fuel trims are closer to zero without much change under load, then check for an engine breathing problem such as a restricted catalytic converter, a restricted intake system, incorrect valve timing, or other things that can affect the engines ablility to move air in and out. </p>",8),s=[r];function c(l,h){return t(),a("div",n,s)}var u=e(i,[["render",c],["__scopeId","data-v-18262cc1"]]);export{u as default};
