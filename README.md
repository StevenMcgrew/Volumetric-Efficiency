# Volumetric-Efficiency

Built with Vue 3, this app allows a person to calculate the volumetric efficiency of an internal combustion engines by using the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor data along with a few other data points in order to determine if the engine has an efficiency problem or if the sensor is faulty. The results can be saved and searched for later. There are also a couple charts to help compare your results with others.
